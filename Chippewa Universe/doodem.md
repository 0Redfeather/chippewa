#Doodem
"ode" means heart. Your doodem comes from your heart, who you are in relation to your extended family.

##Clan System
The clan system is made of 5 main groups with many subgroups

###Bimaawidaasi group
The Bimaawidaasi group was charged with scouting, hunting and gathering.

    "Hooves" subdivision:

        Adik (Caribou) (Al, Ms, Oj, Od) — The Adik totem is common among the Ojibwa and Oji-Cree north of Lake Superior. A prominent family from this doodem from the Grand Portage area relocated to La Pointe and produced the chiefs Mamongazeda and Waubojeeg. Later members of this branch became leaders at Sault Ste.

###Nooke group
The Nooke group was responsible for defense and healing. Though today the Bear Clan has all merged into a single clan known as Nooke, at one time the Bear was the largest — so large, in fact, that it was sub-divided into body parts such as the head (Makoshtigwaan or "bear-skull"), the ribs and the feet (Nookezid or "tender-foot"), as well as different types of bears such as the Waabishki-makwa or "white black bear" and the Mishimakwa or "grizzly bear".

Metaphors

On occasion, instead of referring to the totem by the actual being's name, a clan is identified instead by a metaphor describing the characteristic of the clan's totem. The metaphors that survive to today include:

    Bimaawidaasi "Carrier" = Amik(we) "Beaver"
    Giishkizhigwan "Cut-tail" = Maanameg "Catfish"
    Nooke "Tender" = Makwa "Bear"
    Baswenaazhi "Echo-maker" = Ajijaak(we) "Crane"
    Bemaangik "Pass-by Sounder" = Owewe "Wild goose"
