# Ancestors
This file contains characters from the stories in the Chippewa Universe that take place before historical times. Many of these characters are based upon Indigenous oral traditions, or characteristics of people that I knew in real life. Ancestors could also be classified as relatives, but for the sake of this universe, I am making up categories of Ancestors and Relatives.
