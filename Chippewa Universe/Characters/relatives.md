# Relatives
This file contains a list of characters for stories taking place within oral traditions (usually within the past 7 generations), historical times (after about 1500 AD), and in present times. Many of the characters here could also be classified as Ancestors, but I am classifying them as relatives due to their relatively closer proximity to us in terms of time and accessibility to historical documents. I am not privileging historical sources over oral traditions, but I do believe that historical sources provide a natural demarcation between people in the past and people today. Namely, those who have not experienced European colonialism, and those who have.

* Among the Lakotas and Northern Cheyennes, the bravest of the brave among the enemy was honored as if he were a brother warrior. One such honoree was Adolph Metzger, killed at the December 21, 1866, Fetterman Fight  and given what amounted to a full-dress military funeral by the warriors who killed him. -- Metzger, born in Württemberg, Germany, first enlisted in the U.S. Army in Philadelphia on May 29, 1855. He put down “laborer” as his vocation. Typically, south German immigrants of this era joined the U.S. Army so they could learn English well enough to succeed as shoemakers or whatever skilled trade they had mastered under the guild system in the German states. Metzger had no such fallback. He signed on for $13 a month. His enlistment signature suggests he was literate if not especially literary. He was 21 years old, 5 feet 5 inches tall, with blue eyes, brown hair and a “dark complection,” likely due to outdoor work before he found a home in the Army.
