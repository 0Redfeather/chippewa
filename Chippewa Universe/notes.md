#Notes
Here is a list of ideas, phrases, and other stuff that I think about in the moment, but am not sure where to put it yet.

* Spiritual energy is a part of everything, even for those who are not Chippewa. They have simply utilized spiritual energy into their own systems. For instance, rather than having the seven grandfather teachings, Europeans have Christianity. The source is the same, but how they wield it has different results.

## phrases
* Guide me so that I may walk a straight path, and the wisdom to know the difference.

## stories
* I want to make one story that includes a scene where a main character kills someone during a battle/skirmish/raid/whatever, and then continues on. I then want to make another story which is entirely about a different main character, but suddenly ends when they are killed by the first main character.

* Maahiingun (the wolf) is a brother to Nanaboozhoo (half man/half spirit); Gzhemnidoo (the
Creator) instructed Maahiingun and Nanaboozhoo to travel together to name and visit all the
plants, animals and places on earth; later, Gzhemnidoo instructed them to walk their separate
paths, but indicated each of their fates would be always tied to that of the other; they would be
feared, respected and misunderstood by the people that would later join them on earth (see 6.8
for a more-detailed account of the story of Maahiingun and Nanaboozhoo).
