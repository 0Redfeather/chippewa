#Notes
Here is a list of ideas, phrases, and other stuff that I think about in the moment, but am not sure where to put it yet.

## phrases
* Guide me so that I may walk a straight path, and the wisdom to know the difference.

## stories
* I want to make one story that includes a scene where a main character kills someone during a battle/skirmish/raid/whatever, and then continues on. I then want to make another story which is entirely about a different main character, but suddenly ends when they are killed by the first main character.
