The Anishinaabe word for saying someone is white is the name of this system. This page describes the system and powers of Europeans that take place in the Chippewa Universe. This essentially describes the Christian system of belief, but from an indigenous perspective. There are plenty of perspectives about Native American beliefs from a Christian perspective, so making Christian Spiritual power a system as understood from an indigenous perspective is the goal here.

While there are larger beliefs that go behind the Christian belief system (Jesus, God, the Holy Spirit, etc.), The source of European power is the same as the spiritual power of Indigenous people. They are simply wielding it in different ways.

Like in the Anishinaabe system, there are 7 "paths" that people should try to master, but Christianity refers to the different ways to master those paths as Edicts. Each edict is generally described by an opposing Virtue and Sin. Another key difference from the pathways is that there is no stress on balance. It is generally believed that one should strive for mastering Virtues while resisting the temptations of Sins. There are those who practice Sin exclusively, but more often then not, people master virtues with sudden outbursts of sin in particular situations.
