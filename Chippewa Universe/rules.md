# The Rules of the Chippewa Universe

Here you will find the rules governing the Chippewa Universe. Anything is possible, within the confines of these rules. (*remember that you need an Anishinaabe word to describe the spiritual stuff)

## Rules of the World

1. There is a physical world, and a spiritual world ("spiritual" is a placeholder for a future word describing these things).
2. The physical and spiritual world overlap where there are living things. But there are also places that are just the physical world and just the spiritual world.
  * Dreaming and the physical world are equally real.
3. The same physical aspects of our real universe (physics, astronomy, biology, ecology, geology, geography, chemistry, etc.) are the same as in the physical world of Chippewa. But some things that take place in the physical world are the result of actions in the spiritual world. And vice-versa.
  * The one exception to this rule, is the ability of people to train their physical bodies to extremes (not just using ). Not like Superman, but pretty strong.
4. The major anthropological events and situations that happened in the history and deep past of Chippewa, are generally the same as that of our real world. No major changes like killing off Hitler. This rule is not ironclad.

## Spirituality
1. The Spirit world (need to think of a specific word for this) permeates where all living beings are. To get away from the spirit world, you have to go where no living beings are (a hard thing to do). (irrelevant to this, but viruses are not living beings and therefore have no spiritual energy.)
2. All physical beings are spiritual, but not all spirits in the physical world require a physical body. Spiritual energy is tied to the physical forms of life, but also seperate.
3. Spiritual energy can be harnessed to various degrees, and in different ways.
4. There are seven different (grandfather teaching) spiritual "pathways".
  * Love, Respect, Bravery, Truth, Honesty, Humility, and Wisdom

  * It is difficult to master a pathway.
  * All pathways are important, but most people can excel in only category. Though it is possible to become proficient in most categories.
  * The way you walk a pathway is important. There is a fundamentalist way to do things, and a way that leads to corruption. The best way to learn a pathway, however, is strike a balance
    * While striking a balance is the "best" way, there are many different ways to master each category down each pathway.
5. Spiritual energy is almost exclusively transferred through touch, objects, or places which have been imbued with energy.

### Spiritual Categories
The seven categories each have two spiritual Attributes that can be trained or affected by life effects in various ways. There are general benefits to mastering a pathway, but how you master Attributes affects how you can use your powers.

People are in the vast majority of cases only able to truly master abilities from one pathway, though they may become proficient in using abilities from other paths. Mastering abilities from other categories becomes exponentially more difficult with each pathway that you become proficient in. 1 mastered pathway, and two proficient pathways are usually possibly with a driven individual. Mastering pathways from one category, however, is difficult in its own right.

Your ability to master pathways is heavily related to your clan. People from particular clans tend to have the same paths they are usually good at. This is often due to the fact that cultural upbringing will often greatly influence who you are. That being said, there are always those individuals who differ from the usual paths, and those who from birth .

While mastering abilities in multiple pathways is difficult, living your life according to all of the pathways benefits your mastery of any pathways abilities. For instance, someone who has mastered and practiced only the Thunder path, will be weaker than someone who lives their life according to all pathways.

Despite the labels of spiritual powers, categories, virtues, etc., these are not ironclad rules for the personality characteristics of individuals. Someone who has mastered the bravery attribute for instance, will have a different way of showing bravery to others who have mastered the same attribute. These individuals will also act "cowardly" in particular situations. 


# Story Writing rules
1. Above all, stories must be believable. If you don't plan for winter, you experience hardship. If you kill someone, there are consequences. There is no writing things specifically for a happy ending. Real endings are the goal.
2. Every person has their own agency, and their own abilities to affect the story. Characters can change their minds, but
3. Nobody is inherently extremely more special than everyone else. There is no chosen one, no ultra powerful genius,
4. Everybody has a specific role to fill in this world based on their "spiritual make-up"
Dreams are as important as the real world.
