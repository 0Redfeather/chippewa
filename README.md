The Chippewa Universe is a fictional world drawing inspiration from Indigenous culture, history, perspectives and lifeways. All stories take place in the Chippewa universe with the same set of rules. Below is a description of what the folders in this repository contain.

## First People
The translation of Anishinaabe is First People, and as such, I thought it would be a good title for the first people that interested readers will meet. It is a short, one page introduction to the universe found on the front page of the website. Needs to be exciting, while introducing some of the themes of the world. Not sure if it should take place in the past or the modern day.

## Chippewa Universe
Contains descriptions of the rules, characters, places, main events, and timelines taking place within the Chippewa Universe. The real sources, events, and people will also be contained in this folder.

## Old Woman from the East
Spring, birth. Super way back in the past

## Southern Cedar
Youth, not knowing anything, getting lost, spiritual guidance. Historical Times?

## West Door
Becoming an adult. Finding death. Present day

## North Wind
Anishinaabe story taking place in the deep past. Rest both during life and death. A time to contemplate. A place of wisdom where elders can share what they've learned
